Part 1: Discussion

1. What are the three main design advantages that object orientation
   can provide? Explain each concept.

Encapsulation - Having related data and behavior (methods) bound together.

Abstraction - Being able to use the methods and class structure without having
to know how it works exactly under the hood.

Polymorphism - Being able to use the same template for data and same methods
that have different results. For example, two different instances/subclasses
may use the same structure for data and method, but depending on more specific
information added to the instance/subclass, the method may have different results.


2. What is a class?

A class is a user-defined data structure built upon (under the hood) the dictionary
data structure, but a class is a much smarter dictionary. Classes are a way to bind
together related data and functionality (method). Instead of having nested dictionaries
to organize related data with its label, classes have "instances" or objects which
can have multiple connected attributes and values. Also, classes can also have related
functionality/methods.


3. What is an instance attribute?
An instance attribute is the like the a nested dictionary within a dictionary.
From a class, the user can create an instance or object using the class. With
that instance or object, the user can create attributes specific to that object.


4. What is a method?
A method is basically the same thing as a function but it specific to the class
and its members (instances/objects). It is used with the dot method.


5. What is an instance in object orientation?




6. How is a class attribute different than an instance attribute?
   Give an example of when you might use each.
